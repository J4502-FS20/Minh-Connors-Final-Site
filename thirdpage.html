  </p>
      <p>Protests and petitions against his symbols around campus began back in 2015, during the height of the 2015-2016 protests against racial inequality. The bronze statue near the tombstone received the bulk of the punishment. From petitions of its removal, posts labeling him rapist, racist, and slave owner. Garbage bags were placed over his head. But the administration did not react to theses acts

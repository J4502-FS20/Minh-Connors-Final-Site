<p>The tombstone of Founding Father and historical rapist Thomas Jefferson is a polarizing symbol. Some would say its a symbol of American history, others would say it's a symbol of hate towards African Americans and women. Either way, it has a unique history. From being designed by Jefferson himself, from surviving damages from vandals and fires. It has been from Virginia to Missouri to Back to Virginia, only to be returned to Missouri. This website will go over the history of the tombstone and the controversy surrounding it.
